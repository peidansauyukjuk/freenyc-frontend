# FREENYC

*FREENYC* is an app for finding free in-person classes offered in the New York Metropolitan Area.

[Backend Github Repo](https://github.com/peidansauyukjuk/freenyc-backend)

Users can

- View class show pages which include details and a map.
- Find classes based on categories.
- Register and login (auth using JWT) to favorite classes and view them on their profile page.

This was a project I made during my time at Flatiron School's Software Engineer Immersive. This is built with a React frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend.
