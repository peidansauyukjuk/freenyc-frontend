## DEV THOUGHTS

When I was starting this project, I was really excited to bring this web-app to life so that everybody can have access to discovering new hobbies at a low-entry cost. But everything changed when I found the existence of CourseHorse and ClassPass. They have so many free classes for their members to try already, so I've decided to retire this project.

## INSTALLATION

If you want to work on this web-app, the following steps will help this get up and running.

1. Fork and clone/download this repo.
2. In your terminal, go to the local repo and run `npm install`. At this point, the client-side is ready and you need to run the server side while developing.
3. Go to [backend](https://github.com/peidansauyukjuk/freenyc-backend) and follow installation instructions there.
4. (optional) Get an API KEY from [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to render different tiles for the map.
5. Start developing!!
