## DEV THOUGHTS

When I was starting this project, I was really excited to bring this web-app to life so that everybody can have access to discovering new hobbies at a low-entry cost. But everything changed when I found the existence of CourseHorse and ClassPass. They have so many free classes for their members to try already, so I've decided to retire this project.
